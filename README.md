# Zibel

A vector drawing tool that runs in the browser, built so AI agents can read and write the document through MCP while a person edits the same file in a normal Illustrator-style canvas.

Zibel is a short form of Zobel / zibeline, the sable marten whose hair makes the finest illustration brushes.

## Status

Milestone M0 is in progress (issue #1). A local Worker already takes MCP calls to create a Document, draw shapes into it, read its outline and render it to PNG. A browser viewer shows each Document live as an Agent draws, and a person can select, move and delete what it drew.

Start here. Domain vocabulary is in [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) and architecture decisions in [docs/adr/](docs/adr/).

## Local development

Needs Node 22 or later.

```sh
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm check   # typecheck, Biome, and Vitest inside workerd
pnpm test:e2e # Playwright smoke test against its own wrangler dev (needs `pnpm exec playwright install chromium`)
pnpm dev     # builds the web app, then wrangler dev: viewer at http://localhost:8787, MCP at /mcp
```

Every MCP request needs `Authorization: Bearer <dev token>`. The dev tokens and the Agent Actor each one maps to are in `DEV_TOKENS` in [apps/edge/wrangler.jsonc](apps/edge/wrangler.jsonc). Documents are stored under `.wrangler/state` and survive a restart of `pnpm dev`. The viewer lists them at http://localhost:8787 and opens one at `/docs/<docId>`: Space-drag or scroll to pan, Ctrl+scroll or pinch to zoom, Z then click (Alt+click) to zoom in (out), Ctrl+0 to fit the Artboards, Ctrl+1 for 100%. Click an object to select it (Shift-click toggles, Alt+Shift-click removes) or drag a marquee over several; drag the Selection to move it, press Delete or Backspace to delete it, Ctrl+A to select all and Ctrl+Shift+A to deselect. Each move or delete is one Transaction by the Actor `user`. Ctrl+Z undoes the Document's latest Transaction, whoever made it, including an Agent's whole Transaction in one step, and Ctrl+Shift+Z redoes it; both are Transactions too. The viewer has no login in M0. The first `pnpm dev` asks once to apply the local D1 migration that indexes Documents.

To connect Claude Code, copy [examples/claude-code.mcp.json](examples/claude-code.mcp.json) to `.mcp.json`, or run:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http zibel http://localhost:8787/mcp -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-token-a"
```

## What it is meant to do

Three kinds of work, all producing editable vector output rather than images:

- Charts and diagrams, from data or from a Mermaid description
- Illustration, icons and logos, with Bezier paths, boolean operations, gradients and an appearance stack
- Freehand drawing with pressure, fitted to editable curves

Agents drive it over MCP. Every edit a person can make in the UI has a matching tool call, and every write returns both the affected node IDs and an optional rendered preview, so an agent can check its own work.

## Planned shape

- Document model is a flat, ID-keyed scene graph serialised as readable JSON
- Rendering starts on Canvas2D and moves to Skia via CanvasKit as object counts grow
- Boolean operations use Skia PathOps; text is shaped with HarfBuzz
- Hosted on Cloudflare, with one Durable Object per document holding authoritative state; the same Worker bundle runs locally under `wrangler dev` and self-hosted under workerd
- MCP is stateless Streamable HTTP only: no stdio, no MCP sessions, every request carries its own token and document address
- Monorepo under `apps/` and `packages/`, laid out in REQUIREMENTS.md section 8.3
