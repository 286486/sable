# The Layers panel lists the tree top of the stack first, toggles through an `update` command, and selects the exact Node a row names

The browser's Layers panel (F-LAYER-01, F-LAYER-03) is drawn from the Document the browser already holds, so an Agent's change shows as soon as its `tx` arrives. It follows Illustrator's Layers panel:

- **Order.** Siblings are listed topmost first, the reverse of draw order. Layers, Groups and leaves nest by `parentId`. Layers start expanded and Groups collapsed; expanding and collapsing is UI state, never sent.
- **Names.** A row shows the Node's `name`, and its `tags` beside it. A Node whose `name` is empty shows its auto-name, `<Rectangle>`, `<Ellipse>`, `<Line>`, `<Polygon>`, `<Star>`, `<Path>`, `<Group>` or `<Layer>`. The auto-name is display only and never stored, so an Agent that reads the Node still sees `name: ""`. A Text Node will be named by its content once Text Nodes exist.
- **Toggles.** The eye and the lock of a row send `{type: "update", nodeId, patch}` (ADR-0010), where `patch` holds only `visible` or `locked`. The DO commits it with `node_update`'s core edit as one Transaction of `user`, or rejects it with `NODE_GONE` like any command naming a deleted Node. A Node under a hidden or locked ancestor is hidden or locked too, as in Illustrator; its own flag is unchanged and its row is dimmed.
- **Selecting.** Clicking a row selects the Node it names, even inside a Group, as Illustrator's target circle does; Shift+click adds or removes it. Clicking a Layer's row selects the selectable objects in it, as Alt+clicking a Layer does, since a Layer itself is never part of the Selection (ADR-0010). A row is highlighted while its Node is selected.
- **Locked Nodes.** The canvas never hits or marquees a hidden or locked Node (ADR-0010). A row can still select a locked Node, so the person can find it, but a drag or Delete leaves it where it is and acts on the rest of the Selection.

## Considered Options

- **A general `update` command taking any `node_update` patch**: renaming and Appearance edits will want it, but the panel only needs two flags, and the browser is untrusted (ADR-0010). The command's patch widens when a gesture needs more.
- **Storing the auto-name as the Node's `name`**: an Agent would read `<Rectangle>` back as if someone had named it, and it would go stale when a Live Shape is converted to a Path.
- **A row click selecting the object the Selection tool would (the outermost Group)**: consistent with the canvas, but then nothing inside a Group could be reached before the Group Selection tool exists.
- **Refusing to select a locked Node**: Illustrator's behaviour, but the issue asks that a row still select it; leaving it out of drags and deletes keeps the lock meaningful.

## Consequences

- The Selection may hold a Node inside a Group or a locked Node, so code that acts on the Selection filters what the gesture may touch.
- No thumbnails, Layer colours, drag reordering, search or filters yet (the rest of F-LAYER-01).
